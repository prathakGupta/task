# Project Overview
This project involves setting up authentication strategies using **Passport.js**, specifically the **GitHub** and **Youtube** strategies for user verification. Although the core structure, including **routes**, **private files**, and **frontend configuration**, has been set up, there are still issues with getting the authentication working as expected.

## Progress
* **Routes**, **Private Files**, **and Frontend Configuration**: Completed
* **Passport Setup**:
  - Implemented passport-github2 strategy for GitHub authentication.
  - Implemented passport-youtube strategy for YouTube authentication.
  - Used official **passport.js** documentation and guides for configuration.
## Challenges
Despite following multiple guides and examples from the official documentation and various sources, including:

- **Passport.js Official Documentation**
- **AI Tools**: ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and BlackBox.

I encountered issues with finalizing the authentication process. Currently, the strategies are not functioning as expected, and I have not been able to resolve the problems despite numerous troubleshooting attempts.
